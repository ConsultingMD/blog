As a rapidly growing team we all felt the need for some team building fun to break
up the steady pace of releases we've been cranking out all summer and once again the
Engineering team cast off from Pier 39 in seek of fortune and adventure.

The day's plan was set a course around the San Francisco waterfront to observe Fleet Week's
Parade of Ships and then bearing off just east of Alcatraz, up through Raccoon Strait and into
Ayala Cove for a BBQ and hike to the top.  The goal was to get to the top by 15:00
when the Blue Angels would be arriving for their final practice.

The peak was achieved just in time for a very low fly by from the Angels announcing their arrival.  Afterwards
Rick treated us(and another group) to an impromptu yo-yo demonstration and then we split off into three
groups and set off down back to the docks to finish off the rest of the steak and take remaining afternoon sunshine.
